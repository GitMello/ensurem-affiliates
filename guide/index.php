        <p>Even if you have health insurance coverage, under Obamacare or otherwise, you could end up paying thousands of dollars for a high deductible and hospital fees if you were injured or diagnosed with a serious <span class="smart-break">medical condition.</span></p>
        <p>Consider that one in five Americans report they’ve struggled to pay medical bills in the past year now have serious financial challenges.<sup>1</sup> Medical Cash Benefits pay you a lump sum cash benefit so you can take care of these expenses.
