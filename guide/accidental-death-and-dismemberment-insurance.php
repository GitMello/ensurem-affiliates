      <h2>Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment</h2>
      <h3>Financial protection after a serious incident</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Where would your family be if you died in a car accident tomorrow? How would you cope if you lost a limb after an accident at work?</p>
      <p>Accidental death &amp; dismemberment (AD&amp;D) insurance plans cover unlikely events, such as dying in an accident versus dying from an illness. As a result, these insurance plans are fairly inexpensive. They pay full benefits to your beneficiaries if you die and benefits to you if you are dismembered. AD&D are substantially less expensive than other types of life insurance because they pay benefits only in the result of an accidental death or dismemberment.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-pad">
      <ul>
        <h2>Do I Really Need an AD&amp;D Plan?</h2>
        <p>You should consider an AD&amp;D plan if you:</p>
        <li>Want to be sure your family is protected if you are in an accident</li>
        <li>Would like to supplement other life insurance or disability coverages</li>
        <li>Feel underinsured and are on a tight budget</li>
        <li>Don’t have any life insurance coverage</li>
        <li>Just want some financial protection in the event of a serious incident</li>
