          <p>Medical bankruptcies in the United States are the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy. For example, consider <span class="smart-break">the following:</span></p>
          <li>Cash can be used for alternative types of medical treatments that may not be covered by your <span class="smart-break">insurance plan.</span></li>
          <li>The average cost for a three-day hospital stay <span class="smart-break">is $30,000.</span></li>
          <li>The average price for cancer drugs for one year of treatment can exceed $100,000.</li>

      <h2>Medical Cash Benefits Plans</h2>
      <h3>Designed to cover a variety of circumstances</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you’re diagnosed with a critical illness, require a hospital stay, or get into an accident, your health insurance plan won’t kick in until you meet your deductible. For those with high-deductible Obamacare plans, this means you could be paying a hefty sum just to cover your deductible. For examples, based on the four Obamacare metal plans, you might have to pay up to 40 percent of healthcare expenses (see chart).</p>
      <p>Make sure you’re covered in the event of an unfortunate medical-related event — especially if you have a high-deductible health insurance plan.</p>
