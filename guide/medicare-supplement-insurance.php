        <p>Original Medicare is coverage managed by the federal government. In most cases, Original Medicare Part A and B are available to you on the first day of the month you turn 65. If your birthday is on the first day of the month, Part A and Part B will start the first day of the prior month. Be sure to review the ‘Choosing a Medigap Policy’ guide to see if you are automatically enrolled in Original Medicare.</p>

      <h3>Currently enrolled and have a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) insurance policy</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you currently have a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policy, you may be paying more than you need to. By comparing rates each year, you could save money on your health insurance.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Medicare Supplement plans may change from year to year. For example, Plan L was made newly available 20XX and might provide a benefit structure more fitting with your budget. Check out the currently available plans approved by CMS by clicking the button below.</p>

      <p>All Medigap plans are standardized according to the federal government and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Every Medigap policy must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and it must be clearly identified as "Medicare Supplement Insurance." Insurance companies can sell you only a "standardized" policy identified in most states by letters.</p>
      <p>Each insurance company decides which Medigap policies it wants to sell, although state laws might affect which ones they offer.</p>

        <h1>Purchasing Your First Medicare Supplement Policy</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Understanding your initial Medigap Open Enrollment Period is important. If you’re nearing 65 and have questions about your Medicare enrollment, we encourage you to review the information below.</p>
        <h2>When’s the best time to buy a Medicare Supplement policy?</h2>
        <p>The best time to buy a Medicare Supplement policy is during your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period. This period lasts for 6 months and begins on the first day of the month in which you’re both 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare Part B. Some states have additional Open Enrollment Periods including those for people under 65. During this period, an insurance company can’t use medical underwriting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-pad">
        <p><strong>Open Enrollment Period (Medicare Supplement)</strong> - A one‑time-only, 6-month period when federal law allows you to buy any Medicare Supplement policy you want that’s sold in your state. It starts in the first month that you’re covered under Medicare Part B, and you’re 65 or older. During this period, you can’t be denied a Medicare Supplement policy or charged more due to past or present health problems. Some states may have additional Open enrollment rights under state law.</p>
        <p><strong>Guaranteed Issue Rights</strong> - These are rights you have in certain situations when insurance companies must offer you certain Medigap policies. In most cases, you have a guaranteed issue right when you have certain types of other health care coverage that changes in some way, like when you lose the other health care coverage. Below is a chart to help you understand your guaranteed issue rights.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important to buy a Medicare Supplement policy when you are first eligible?</h2>
        <li>Insurance companies cannot refuse to sell you a Medicare Supplement policy it offers</li>
        <li>Companies cannot charge you more for a Medicare Supplement policy than they charge someone with no health problems</li>
        <li>You don’t have to wait for coverage to start</li>

      <h2>Some Exceptions</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>While the insurance company can’t make you wait for your coverage to start, it may be able to make you wait for coverage related to a pre-existing condition. A pre-existing condition is a health problem you have before the date a new insurance policy starts. In some cases, the Medicare Supplement insurance company can refuse to cover your out-of-pocket costs for these pre-existing health problems for up to 6 months. This is called a “pre-existing condition waiting period.” After 6 months, the Medicare Supplement policy will cover the pre-existing condition.</p>
      <p>Coverage for a pre-existing condition can only be excluded if the condition was treated or diagnosed within 6 months before the coverage starts under the Medicare Supplement policy. This is called the “look-back period.” After the 6-month pre‑existing condition waiting period, the Medicare Supplement policy will cover the condition that was excluded. Remember, for Medicare‑covered services, Original Medicare will still cover the condition, even if the Medicare Supplement policy won’t, but you’re responsible for the Medicare coinsurance or copayment.</p>
