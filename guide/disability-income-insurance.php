        <h2>Disability Income Insurance</h2>
        <h3>Protect your paycheck when facing the unexpected</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>What would happen if you got injured and unable to work, or were sick for several months and had no income to rely on? If you had disability income insurance, you would be receiving a monthly benefit until you could return to work. Disability income (DI) insurance protects your paycheck so you and your family can continue maintaining your standard of living even when you are sick or injured.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest myths about disabilities, according to LIMRA, is that disabilities only occur after serious accidents. The truth is that many people become disabled because of chronic back issues or muscle pain. Consider that more than 50% of over 37 million Americans classified as disabled are still in their working years (18 to 64 years of age), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
        <p>Being unable to work and dealing with rising medical costs makes having some type of insurance protection more important than ever. Any Social Security benefits are paid in addition to your disability income insurance benefits so you will be financially secure until you are able to earn an income again.</p>
        <h2>How Dental Insurance &amp; Vision Plans Work</h2>
        <p>Dental and vision insurance plans can be added to existing healthcare plans so you have coverage for any health conditions related to your ocular and oral health. If you are currently paying for dental visits, vision exams, and other services at the dentist or eye doctor, you could be saving up to 50% or more with a basic insurance plan. These plans are designed to reduce your out-of-pocket costs for preventive care, routine services, and certain procedures.</p>

      <h2>How Disability Income Insurance Works</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>You will receive disability income benefits when you meet the definition of total disability or partial disability defined by your insurance company. In most cases, partial disability is when you are unable to perform essential tasks of employment or have to reduce your hours (and compensation) significantly because of your disability. Total disability is when you cannot perform any basic duties of you job and at the end of a specified period outlined in your policy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-pad">
      <p>Many disability policies include a waiting period that range anywhere from 90 to 365 days before you can receive income replacement benefits, depending on the policy. You need to consider the waiting period and also the length of the benefit period — the length of time you will receive benefits — which can range anywhere from one year to five or more years, when shopping for a policy. Many companies offer short term or long term policies and some policies also include other features that provide additional monetary benefits.</p>
