        <h2>Dental &amp; Vision Plans</h2>
        <h3>Smile &amp; see the savings add up</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The cost of dental cleanings, vision exams, and general dentistry and vision care can really add up. Save money while making sure you and your family maintain optimal oral health and healthy vision with the right dental and vision insurance plan. Many plans cover routine visits at 100% and pay up to half or more for treatment costs. For a low monthly payment, you can afford to have your family visit the dentist and eye doctor without worrying about excessively high fees.</p>
        <h2>How Dental Insurance &amp; Vision Plans Work</h2>
        <p>Dental and vision insurance plans can be added to existing healthcare plans so you have coverage for any health conditions related to your ocular and oral health. If you are currently paying for dental visits, vision exams, and other services at the dentist or eye doctor, you could be saving up to 50% or more with a basic insurance plan. These plans are designed to reduce your out-of-pocket costs for preventive care, routine services, and certain procedures.</p>
